# Roundware Documentation

This is the repository for the [Roundware Documentation website](http://roundware.org/docs).

This is a [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) project, which builds a static
site from these source files.

## Contributions Welcome!

If you find a typo or you feel like you can improve the HTML, CSS, or
JavaScript, we welcome contributions. Feel free to open issues or pull
requests like any normal GitHub project, and we'll merge it in.

This documentation framework is shamelessly ripped off from the amazing
[Vagrant docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com).  We searched for ages for the
right balance between good looks, easy navigability, convenient updating
capability and general flexiblity in a doc system and this hits all those marks.

Thank you for sharing, wonderful Vagrant people!
