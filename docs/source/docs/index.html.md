# Roundware Documentation

Welcome to the Roundware docs! This site is designed to document Roundware
in a dynamic way as the project evolves.  That said, the documentation
is currently in alpha form, at best.  We are starting small and growing from
there, so please bear with us.

If you're interested in helping make these docs better, please grab the code on
[Github](https://github.com/hburgund/roundware-server), make your suggested changes,
submit a pull request and we'll be glad to incorporate the improvements.

Thanks and enjoy!
