# Tags Admin

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
	<p>
		<strong>DEFINITION:</strong> Metadata used to describe assets.  Tags are arranged by tag category.  For example, the tags within the 'gender' tag category could be 'male' and 'female'.  Tags are very flexible and allow for collecting many different types of metadata to be used for filtering the assets at a later time.
	</p>
</div>

A full explanation of tag setup and fields can be found on the [Tag Setup](../setup/tag.html) page and should be
reviewed and understood before these Tag Admin instructions will be useful.

# Batch Add Tags

Because tags are grouped by tag category, there is a convenient facility for adding
multiple tags all within the same tag category.  This is accessed via the **Batch create tags**
button on the tag list view.

Select a tag category and then add as many tags as you want for that category all at once by
entering their pertinent details.
