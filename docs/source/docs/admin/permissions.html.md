# Object Permissions Admin

Object permissions allow Roundware instances with more than one project to restrict access to data on a
project-by-project basis for each User.  This is very handy if each project has a different administrator
and the data should not be shared.

To access Object permissions, navigate to the project you want to set permissions for and click the
**Object permissions** button:

![Object permissions](../docimg/admin/object-perm-project.png)

You can assign Users or Groups permissions to the project:

![Object permissions](../docimg/admin/object-perm-detail.png)

Type a User's name in the User identification form field and click *Manage User* to set permissions for
that User for the Project selected.

![Object permissions](../docimg/admin/object-perm-edit.png)

Groups can be setup similarly.
