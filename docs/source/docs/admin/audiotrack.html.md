# Audiotrack Admin

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
    <p>
        <strong>DEFINITION:</strong> A linear assemblage of audio assets and silence (‘dead air’) which dynamically forms part of each stream by incorporating audio assets into the stream. There can be multiple audiotracks for each project and they determine how many audio assets can play simultaneously.
    </p>
</div>

All projects must have at least one Audiotrack in order to add assets to streams.

Click the Audiotrack id of the Audiotrack you want to view and edit to open the Audiotrack Detail view.  All Audiotrack fields are
detailed on the [Audiotrack setup](../setup/audiotrack.html) page.  Duration values are in *nanoseconds*, so get used to lots of zeros!
