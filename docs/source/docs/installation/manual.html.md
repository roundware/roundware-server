# Installing Roundware

## Overview

Roundware is a client-server system.  The server runs on Ubuntu Linux, version 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin and clients are available for iOS, Android and HTML5 browsers.  This document outlines the steps required to setup a Roundware server with a basic installation that can be accessed through any of these clients.
For more information about Roundware functionalities and projects that use the platform, please check out:
[roundware.org](http://roundware.org "Roundware")

## Requirements
In order to successfully install Roundware, the following requirements must be met:

 * server running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin
 * root access
 * familiarity with Apache, MYSQL, and icecast

Unless stated otherwise, all scripts referred to in this guide reside in the root directory of the Roundware distribution:
__roundware-server__

In order to successfully install all required packages, make sure `/etc/apt/sources.list` has multiverse repositories enabled.

## Pre-requisites
Roundware requires many packages to support streaming and management.  Run the *INSTALL-prerequisites* script to install them:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ sh INSTALL-prereqs
```

All packages contained therein MUST be installed successfully to run Roundware fully.

## Icecast

Roundware uses Icecast to stream audio, much like internet radio stations.  After installation, Icecast requires some basic configuration to function properly with Roundware.  In certain instances, icecast2 prompts during the install process for the hostname and passwords.  Hostname should be `localhost`.

Some configuration changes are required to the basic Icecast configuration, and they must be in sync with the configured values for Roundware.  These files must be edited as superuser (sudo).  Sample icecast config files are included in the distribution in the `roundware-server/files` directory.

First, you'll edit the base icecast config:

```
user@machine:$ sudo vim /etc/default/icecast2
```

Set/verify the enable value to true in the last line of this file: `ENABLE=true`

Next, you'll edit the base icecast config:

```
user@machine:$ sudo vim /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml
```

Set passwords (in 3 places) to correspond with what is in the Roundware default configuration, currently set in `roundwared/settings.py`.  You may have already been prompted for these passwords during the icecast install process, in which case you should simply verify that they are in the xml.  The default config has the password 'roundice'.  Also, set the max number of sources to 200.

```
<sources>200</sources>
---
<authentication>
    <!-- Sources log in with username 'source' -->
    <source-password>rwice</source-password>
    <!-- Relays log in username 'relay' -->
    <relay-password>rwice</relay-password>

    <!-- Admin logs in with the username given below -->
    <admin-user>admin</admin-user>
    <admin-password>rwice</admin-password>
</authentication>
```

Restart Icecast for changes to take effect:

```
user@machine:$ sudo /etc/init.d/icecast2 restart
```

To verify that icecast is up and running go to `http://<your.roundware.host>:8000` to see the default icecast admin page.

## MYSQL

Roundware uses MYSQL and requires a dedicated database with a dedicated user.  Create the default values for this user by running the `INSTALL-mysql` script.  You'll be prompted 3 times for your mysql root password, which you configured during installation.

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ sh INSTALL-mysql
```

You may change the database name and account info to fit your needs, but if you do, be sure to change the Roundware config `/etc/roundware/rw` and the django settings `roundware-server/roundware/settings.py` to reflect your changes.

## Apache

Apache must be configured to forward requests to Roundware fastcgi endpoint.  A default config is included at `roundware-server/files/apache-config-example`.  If installing on a clean 12.04 machine, this file can simply be copied to the apache configuration directory, though there are several changes that should be made to reflect your environment.  Look for the following lines in the `apache-config-example`, and change them to reflect the location to which you've installed Roundware:

```
DocumentRoot /home/ubuntu/roundware-server/roundware/
FastCGIExternalServer /home/ubuntu/roundware-server/roundware/mysite.fcgi -host 127.0.0.1:3033
```

Then copy sample config to live location:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ sudo cp files/apache-config-example /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
```

Restart Apache for changes to take effect:

```
user@machine:$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

## Roundware Installation

Modify the Roundware install script to reflect your codebase location:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ vim install_clean_django_rw.sh
```

Confirm CODE\_PATH and DIST\_PATH are correct for your system.
Run the `INSTALL-roundware` script (which calls `install_clean_django_rw.sh` among other things):

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ sh INSTALL-roundware
```

Give ownership of the log file created in this script to the user who will be running Roundware:

```
user@machine: sudo chown [your user] /var/log/roundware
```

### Configure Django for Roundware

Reset the Django database by running the `resetDb.sh` script:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server/roundware$ sh resetDB.sh
```
*Note - this script may prompt for the username and password for your database.  If you changed these values from the defaults when creating the Roundware db, the changes must be reflected here.*

You'll be asked if you want to create a superuser like so:

```
You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):
```

Answer yes, and provide the default values for username ('round') and password ('round').  Note that any subsequent changes must be reflected in `settings.py`.  The email address can be anything, and is not currently used.

If you have a fixture data file, you can populate your database with this data by running the django command:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server/roundware$ python manage.py loaddata <path_to_fixture>
```

The base Roundware install package includes a standard SQL file to populate a default database with the basic data you will need to test your installation.  That can be installed as such:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ mysql
```

Make some edits to the Django settings file, `roundware/settings.py`:

```
ANONYMOUS_USER_ID = 0 // change this to the proper id for AnonymousUser in database for Guardian
# settings for notifications module - email account from which notifications will be sent
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
```

You are now ready to reset django and run Roundware:

```
user@machine:~/roundware-server$ sh install_clean_django_rw.sh
user@machine:~/roundware-server/roundware$ sh startFCGI.sh
```

Open a browser and browse to `http://your.roundware.host/admin`, and verify you see the django admin page.

Remember, for debugging information, you can check the apache log files:
 * `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
 * `/var/log/apache2/error.log`

as well as the Roundware log:
 * `/var/log/roundware`

## Roundware Development

Roundware uses separate pip requirements files and Django settings files for development.
If you are running Roundware as a development server, you should run:

```
user@machine:pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

to get the additional requirements for development and testing.

You should also edit your `~/.bashrc` file (or other method of setting user-wide persistent
environment variables) to add:

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=roundware.settings.dev
```

Note also that you can use a `local_settings.py` (not in version control) inside
of the `roundware/settings/` directory.

## Basic Testing

Here are some simple browser tests to see if your Roundware installation is functioning properly (substitute your RW server url):

```
http://localhost:8888/api/1/?operation=get_config&project_id=1
http://localhost:8888/api/1/?operation=get_tags&session_id=2891
http://localhost:8888/api/1/?operation=request_stream&session_id=2891
http://localhost:8888/api/1/?operation=modify_stream&session_id=2892&tags=3,5,8
```

The first two should return JSON objects containing information about your Roundware project.  The second two will create and then modify an audio stream.  You can verify stream creation in the Icecast admin, but of course, the true verification is by listening which can be done in iTunes or in certain browsers.

To run unit and functional tests and see test coverage, you will need the development requirements (see above).
To run tests and get a report of test coverage:

```
user@machine ~/roundware-server/test.sh
```
