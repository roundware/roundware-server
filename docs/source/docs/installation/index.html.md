# Installing Roundware

Roundware can be installed in several different ways depending on your needs.  We provide a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) install which is by far the easiest method, but you can choose to install manually if you want to modify things or get into the details more directly.

After you have your environment setup, we provide a few API tests to make sure all is working properly and to familiarize yourself with the typical set of API calls.
