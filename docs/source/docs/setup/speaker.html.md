# Speaker

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
    <p>
        <strong>DEFINITION:</strong> A geo-located object that continuously broadcasts audio within a specified area.
    </p>
</div>

Every project - even if geo\_listen is not enabled - must have at least one active speaker in order to generate audio streams.  If geo\_listen=N, the latitude, longitude and radius of the speaker are ignored, but if geo\_listen=Y, then the latitude, longitude and radius determine where in the physical world the audio associated with the speaker can be heard.
