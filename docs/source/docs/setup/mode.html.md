# Modes

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
	<p>
		<strong>DEFINITION:</strong> Modes are the basic functionalities that a Roundware instance provides.  Currently, Roundware only handles audio, so there are two available modes, one for consuming audio streams (Listen) and one for contributing audio recordings (Speak).  In the future when more media types are added to Roundware such as video, photos and text, new modes will need to be added for consuming and contributing assets of those media types.  The Mode concept is primarily used to help organize and assign tags in the client.
	</p>
</div>

Roundware comes pre-configured with the two standard Modes: Listen and Speak.  You can extend the functionality by adding new Modes as needed.
