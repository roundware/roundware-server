# Tag Relationships

Tag relationships are used to control what tags are presented to the user based on their previous tag selections.  For example, if I have a set of questions I only want to present to male participants and another to female participants, I could require the gender tag category to be selected first and then present only the questions related to the user's selection.

This is a very handy and power feature that allows for much more customization of the user experience as well as specificity of asset collection.

Tag relationships are handled with a self-referential many-to-many field in the tag object.
