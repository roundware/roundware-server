# Tags Data Field

The `rw_tag.data` field can be used for many purposes.  Right now, its primary use is to assign html classes to tags for display purposes in the tag webviews.

We would like to expand the data field to consisting of a flexible set of key/value pairs that would be returned in get_tags as a JSON node. This expandability will provide much more utility and should make it simpler to manage than a text field.
